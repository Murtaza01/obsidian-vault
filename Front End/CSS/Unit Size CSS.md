em= 100% of the parent 

its a relative size, to whatever *the parent* size is, so if we change the size of the parent, the size of the child will be changed

for example, if the parent element had a font size of **20px** adding 2em to a child element will be 20x2= 40px

rem= 100% of the root element *(html)*

it is recommend that we use **rem** because it doesn't make a mess and make you keep track of every parent size.
