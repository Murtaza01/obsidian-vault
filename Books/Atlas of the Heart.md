“Anxiety is contagious. Intensity and reactivity only
breed more of the same. Calm is also contagious. Nothing
is more important than getting a grip on your own
reactivity.”

# Belonging 

"Our yearning for belonging is so hardwired that we often try to
acquire it by any means possible, including trying to fit in and hustling
for approval and acceptance." p.225

"Because we can feel belonging only if we have the courage to share
our most authentic selves with people, our sense of belonging can
never be greater than our level of self-acceptance."

# Connection

Across my research, I define connection as the energy that
exists between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued;
when they can give and receive without judgment; and when
they derive sustenance and strength from the relationship {p.238}

# loneliness

At the heart of loneliness is the absence of meaningful social interaction—an intimate relationship,friendships, family gatherings, or even community or work group connections.

# Trust 

BRAVING:

1. Boundaries: You respect my boundaries, and when you’re not
clear about what’s okay and not okay, you ask. You’re
willing to say no.

2. Reliability: You do what you say you’ll do. At work, this means
staying aware of your competencies and limitations so you
don’t over promise and are able to deliver on commitments
and balance competing priorities.

3. Accountability: You own your mistakes, apologize, and make
amends.

4. Vault: You don’t share information or experiences that are not
yours to share. I need to know that my confidences are
kept, and that you’re not sharing with me any information
about other people that should be confidential.

5. Integrity: You choose courage over comfort. You choose what
is right over what is fun, fast, or easy. And you choose to
practice your values rather than simply professing them.

6. Nonjudgment: I can ask for what I need, and you can ask for
what you need. We can talk about how we feel without
judgment. We can ask each other for help without judgment.

7. Generosity: You extend the most generous interpretation
possible to the intentions, words, and actions of others.

# defensiveness 

our self-esteem is considered fragile when our failures, mistakes,
and imperfections decrease our self-worth.

# Hurt

Most behaviors that result in hurt
feelings are not intended to be hurtful; they typically involve actions
that are thoughtless, careless, or insensitive. However, “the more
intentional an action is perceived [as], the more hurtful it feels.”

# Happiness  

**Happiness** is stable, longer-lasting, and normally the result of effort.
It’s lower in intensity than joy, and more self-focused. With happiness,
we feel a sense of being in control. Unlike joy, which is more internal,
happiness seems more external and circumstantial.

# Joy


**Joy** is sudden, unexpected, short-lasting, and high-intensity. It’s
characterized by a connection with others, or with God, nature, or the
universe. Joy expands our thinking and attention, and it fills us with a
sense of freedom and abandon.


He hypothesizes that the very
nature of joy pushes the boundaries of our ability to communicate
about lived experience via spoken language. He also suggests that
because language can shape lived experience, cultures that have
more words to describe the emotion of joy may also experience joy
more richly.

# Contentment

I define contentment as the feeling of completeness,
appreciation, and “enoughness” that we experience when our
needs are satisfied

Several researchers categorize all emotions into one of two
categories: low arousal and high arousal. Contentment is
characterized as a low-arousal positive emotion, along with peace,
tranquility, and satisfaction. These are comfy, old-pair-of-jeans
emotions.

# Gratitude

There’s research that shows
that gratitude is correlated with better sleep, increased creativity,
***decreased entitlement*** 

But gratitude makes us appreciate the value of something, and
when we appreciate the value of something, we extract more
benefits from it; we’re less likely to take it for granted, In effect, I think gratitude allows us to participate more in life.
We notice the positives more, and that magnifies the pleasures
you get from life. Instead of adapting to goodness, we
celebrate goodness.

Gratitude is a practice that can enrich our lives in meaningful ways.

# Foreboding joy

`is when you have joy and expect that there is a cost for it, or rather that you may pay the price and thus prepare yourself for the disastor. when you feel joy, you become vulnerable and you are afried to be hurt in this state` 

# Anger

anger is an emotion that we feel when something gets in the way of a
desired outcome or when we believe there’s a violation of the
way things should be

![[Anger.png]]

Anger is a catalyst. Holding on to it will make us exhausted and
sick. Internalizing anger will take away our joy and spirit;
externalizing anger will make us less effective in our attempts
to create change and forge connection. It’s an emotion that we
need to transform into something life-giving: courage, love,
change, compassion, justice.


# contempt

> Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

contempt, criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling

![[Four horsman.png]]

In the words of the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, contempt is “the unsullied conviction of the worthlessness of another.”

# Disgust 

With contempt, we look down on the other person and we want
to exclude or ignore them. With disgust, inferiority is not the
issue, the feeling is more physical—we want to avoid being
“poisoned” (either literally or figuratively).

while disgust in an interpersonal context is thought to
“protect” us from unseemly behavior or contamination of the soul

Once we dehumanize people, violence and cruelty
toward them become easier to perpetrate because the parts of us
that are hardwired to not hurt other people turn off—in our minds,
we’ve stripped them of their humanity.

# Dehumanization

Smith explains that very deep and natural inhibitions prevent us from treating other people like animals, game, or dangerous predators. He
writes, “Dehumanization is a way of subverting those inhibitions.”

# humility 

Humility is openness to new learning combined with a balanced
and accurate assessment of our contributions, including our
strengths, imperfections, and opportunities for growth.

“hubris” is Greek and was used to describe a pride and ambition so great that they offend the gods and lead to one’s downfall

Theorizing is part of meaning-making

# near enemies

The near enemy of love is attachment. Attachment
masquerades as love. It says, “I will love this person (because
I need something from them).” Or, “I’ll love you if you’ll love me
back. I’ll love you, but only if you will be the way I want.” This
isn’t the fullness of love. Instead there is attachment—there is
clinging and fear. True love allows, honors, and appreciates;
attachment grasps, demands, needs, and aims to possess.

I needed the concept of near enemies because when it comes to
cultivating meaningful connection, the far enemies—the real opposites
—are not what get in the way most of the time. They’re easy to
recognize—we don’t get tricked into believing that everything is okay;
they are up front with their disconnection. It’s the near enemies of
connection
