# Gratitude vs Worst case scenario 

gratitude might actually be the opposite of thinking about the worst case scenario, because when we do practice gratitude, we appreciate  the good things, and when we think about the worst case scenario we often are afraid of the bad things

so when we appreciate the good things, that will makes us hopeful about the future, and we wouldn't worry much about the worst case scenario, it will serve as a protection from these thoughts, from negative evaluation

more thoughts needs to be put into here...

# anger as a secondary emotion

so the writer thinks that anger is not a primary emotion and it always a mask for another emotion, because of our lack of expression, we perfer to say we are angry than we are hurt

ask yourself the next time you become angry, is this pure anger? whats behind the anger?
