# gradient text

we can have gradient text with this code:

```css
h1{
background-image:linear-gradient(to right,#ccc,#3737);
-webkit-background-clip:text;
color:transparent;
}
```

in the above code, we give a gradient background and then we make the image clipped as the text, then i need to make the color transparent so that the background appears

*this works for images too!*
