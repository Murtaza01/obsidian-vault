There is three ways (to my knowledge) to add shadows

1. to <b>text</b> which you can use 
   [text-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow)
2. to <b>boxes</b> which you can use
   [box-shadow ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)
3. to <b>images</b> which you use
   filter: [drop-shadow()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow)

# box-shadow

the box-shadow takes up 5 values,which looks like this:

offset-x offset-y blur-radius spread-radius color; 

if offset-x was postive value then it will be to the left if negative to the right
y if was postive then its down, up if negative
