# accessing a property in an object with a dash -

if we want to access a property in an object that has a dash in it, for example `person-name` we can do that using the following syntax:

```js
const object = {
'person-name':'ahmed',
age: 8
}

object['person-name']
```

i don't use dot with it and the object key have to also be wrapped in quotes
