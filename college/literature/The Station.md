is tragic comedy play that  tells a story about different characters and their struggles and interactions with one another, it is sit in one place (a train station) located in (Batha in Nassriya).

there are many characters that comes and go, and have dialog with one another, im going to talk about what i think is the most important characters:

sabber whom his wife died and got crazy after
an old man who is rooted in iraqi tradition 
abo loie, the 'educated' person

> sabber

the first scene we see from the play is for a crazy person, we do not know about him until then its reveled that his 'craziness' has a reason, his wife died with his child in the station, and he is still looking for her in the station, we call it crazy, but his wife death was so traumatizing to him that he just could not accept it, traumatize people actually can not differentiate between the past and present...

> abo loie and the old man

i grouped these two man together because of their dialog, we know little about each of them, but there much is revealed when they have a conversion, they represent a whole generation, of old vs modern, traditional vs progressive 

in their dialog, abo loie talk about classes, how he sees himself belonging  to the educated, intelligent, modern, knowledgeable class

and how the old man to the traditional ignorant and basic class
