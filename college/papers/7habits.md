# be proactive

Being proactive means that you don't get upset by rude comments from people
nor by bad weather or bad circumcises of life, because all these are things
external to you, and thus you cannot control.

Instead you should focus on things you can control, your response to these things,
you attitude, your judgement.

This chapter seems influenced by stoicism[^1] 

# put first things first

this habit is all about setting your priorities in place, doing important
things first so they don't get crammed and become urgent, having a planner 
that we do weekly so we finish our tasks before the deadlines.

it is important that we plan our tasks so we don't forgot them and know exactly what
we have to do this particular day.

# seek first to understand,then to be understood

Understanding people is one of the best habit to have a better relationships,
and genuine communication with people, it starts by listening to people.

However there is many things we do that stops us from understanding people:

+ Advising: when we give advice before understanding the situation, or when they didn't ask for one.
+ Selective listening: when we listen to only the things that interest us.
+ Probing: when we listen in order to get certain information.
+ Judging: when we judge people about what they say and don't offer our ears.

The author says that 7% of communication is done with words, 53% is done with 
body language, and 40% is done with tone and the feelings in the tone.

The other part of this chapter talks about seeking to be understood,
because 'unexpressed feelings never die. They are buried
alive and come forth later in uglier ways. You’ve got to share your feelings
or they’ll eat your heart out.'

# Synergy

"Alone we can do so little, together we can do much"
 Helen kellr

Synergy it mean when tow or more people working together to create

Synergy is everywhere in nature, the flock of geese its flying along
in a formation, by flying in a formation the whole flock can fly
71% further than if each goose flew alone, when geese flaps its wings it creates an '' for the geese, that follows.
