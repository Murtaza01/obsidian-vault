# change title position

to do that we can just add:

```
title_align left|center|right
```

# open application to a specific workspace

we can do that using two ways:

```
for_window [class="Spotify"] move to workspace 3
assgin [class="qutebrowser"] 1
```

some application need the first method because they are only known after
opening (after initating a window)

# toggle workspace (back_and_forth)

we can activite such option in our config file

```
workspace_auto_back_and_forth yes|no
```

this will get back to the last workspace you were in with the keybind
of the workspace you are in
