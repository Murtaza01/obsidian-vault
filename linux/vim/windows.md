# windows

to open mulitple windows we can use:

:split filename

:vsplit filename == opens virtically

we can close a window by using:

:quit
or 
ctrl-w + c 

to switch between windows if we split them we can use:

ctrl-w k == upper window
ctrl-w j == lower window
ctrl-w h == left window
ctrl-w o == closes all other windows and keep current
w= window, h= is using the same keys to move
