We can use Macros to do repetitive things, for example creating 
a react component function.

To record macros we use
```
qa
```
where a is any letter

then `q` to end it

to excute macros we use:

```
@a
```

Where a is the corresponding letter.

```
~
```

to upper case letters.

```
:let @z = @a
```

to copy a macro from a to z.
