I undertook to conquer myself rather than fortune, and to alter
my desires rather than change the order of the world, and to
accustom myself to believe that nothing is entirely in our power
except our own thoughts

I must die. But must I die bawling? I must be put in
chains – but moaning and groaning too? I must be exiled; but is there
anything to keep me from going with a smile, calm and self-
composed

‘I have to die. If it is now, well then I die now; if later, then now I will take my lunch, since the hour for lunch has arrived – and dying I will tend to
later.’ 

A certain athlete, at risk of dying unless his genitals were
amputated, made a comparable choice. His brother, a philosopher,
went and asked him, ‘Well, my brother, what’s it going to be? Will you
have them amputated, and return to life in the gymnasium?’ The man
refused to submit to the indignity, however, and summoned the will to
die. [26] Someone asked, ‘Did he choose death as an athlete or as a
philosopher?’ ‘As a man,’ 

Consider at what price you sell your integrity; but please, for
God’s sake, don’t sell it cheap. 

If being related to the emperor
or any of the other great ones at Rome is enough to live without fear,
in privilege and security, shouldn’t having God as our creator, father
and defender protect us even more from trouble and anxiety?

Whenever you close your doors and turn out your
lights, remember, never say to yourself that you are alone; [14] you’re
not. God is inside

But I don’t understand the will of nature. Who will explain it to
me? I’m told Chrysippus can. [16] So off I go to find out what this
interpreter of nature has to say. But then there’s a passage I have
trouble with, so I cast about for someone to explain the explanation.
‘Here,’ I say, ‘have a look and tell me what this means’ – as if the
thing were in Latin.

when starving people see you gobbling down
food all by yourself, you know one of them will make a grab at it. So
don’t provoke them – don’t air your clothes at the window!
[15] Something similar happened to me the other day. I keep an
iron lamp by my household shrine. Hearing a noise from my window, I
ran down and found the lamp had been lifted. I reasoned that the thief
who took it must have felt an impulse he couldn’t resist. So I said to
myself, ‘Tomorrow you’ll get a cheaper, less attractive one made of
clay.’

Now, for what purpose did nature arm us with reason? To make
the correct use of impressions.

‘My friend, what is it you want?’
‘I am satisfied if my desires and aversions agree with nature,

The true man is revealed in difficult times. So when trouble comes,
think of yourself as a wrestler whom God, like a trainer, has paired
with a tough young buck. [2] For what purpose? To turn you into
Olympic-class material.

no one can take them from you or prevent you
from using these qualities except yourself – which you do the moment
you begin to care about what isn’t yours, surrendering what is yours
in the process.

The cause of our assenting to the truth of something is that it
appears to be fact. [2] And it is impossible to assent to anything that
does not appear to be fact. Why? It is the mind’s nature: it will assent
to the truth, reject what is false and suspend judgement in doubtful
cases.

God has fixed this law, and says, ‘If you want something good,
get it from yourself.’ But you say, ‘No, I’ll get it from another.’ I say,
‘No – get it from yourself.’ [5] If a tyrant threatens me at court, I say,
‘What is he threatening?’ If he says, ‘I will put you in chains,’ I say,
‘He is threatening my hands and feet.’ [6] If he says, ‘I will behead
you,’ I say, ‘He is threatening my neck.’ If he says, ‘I will throw you
into prison,’ I say, ‘He is threatening my entire body’; if he threatens
exile, I say the same. [7] ‘Well, then, aren’t you threatened, even a
little?’ If I feel that these things are nothing to me, then no. [8] But if I
fear for any of them, then, yes, it is I who am threatened.
Who is there left for me to fear, and over what has he control? Not
what is in my power, because no one controls that except myself. As
for what is not in my power, in that I take no interest.

Pain too is just a scary mask: look under it and you will see.
The body sometimes suffers, but relief is never far behind. And if that
isn’t good enough for you, the door stands open; otherwise put up
with it.

Even now, if the opportunity presents itself, I know you will go
off to read and make public those compositions, and you’ll pride
yourself on being fluent in the dialogue form. [35] Don’t do it, man.
What I would rather hear from you is, ‘Look how I don’t fail in my
desires, or have experiences I don’t want. I’ll prove it to you in the
case of death, I’ll prove it to you in the case of physical pain, in the
case of prison, of condemnation, and ill repute.’ That’s the real test of
a youth fit to finish school

If you want to keep
your character in line with nature, you have every hope of success, all
the means you need, and not a worry in the world. [3] Because if you
want to keep what is yours by right and is by nature free – and these
are the only things you want – you have nothing to worry about. No
one else controls them or can take them away from you

If, however, you want to keep hold of externals – your body,
belongings and reputation – then my advice to you is that your
preparations better begin early and will have to be long. You will need
to research the character of the judge, of course, and make a study
of your opponent too. [11] If grovelling is called for, then be prepared
to grovel – to weep and holler too. [12] Whenever externals are more
important to you than your own integrity, then be prepared to serve
them the remainder of your life. Don’t hedge and agree to be their
slave, then change your mind later; [13] commit to one or the other
position at once and without reserve. Choose to be either free or a
slave, enlightened or a fool, a thoroughbred or a nag. Either resign
yourself to a life of abuse till you die, or escape it immediately. For
God’s sake, don’t put up with years of abuse, and then change your
mind! [14] This humiliation can be avoided before it begins: just
decide now what you think is truly good and bad

So in life our first job is this, to divide and
distinguish things into two categories: externals I cannot control, but
the choices I make with regard to them I do control. Where will I find
good and bad? [5] In me, in my choices. Don’t ever speak of ‘good’
or ‘bad’, ‘advantage’ or ‘harm’, and so on, of anything that is not your
responsibility.

It’s something like going on an ocean voyage.
What can I do? Pick the captain, the boat, the date, and the best
time to sail. [11] But then a storm hits. Well, it’s no longer my
business; I have done everything I could. It’s somebody else’s
problem now – namely the captain’s. [12] But then the boat actually
begins to sink. What are my options? I do the only thing I am in a
position to do, drown – but fearlessly, without bawling or crying out to
God, because I know that what is born must also die. [13] I am not
Father Time; I’m a human being, a part of the whole, like an hour in a
day. Like the hour I must abide my time, and like the hour, pass. [14]
What difference does it make whether I go by drowning or disease? I
have to go somehow.

In short, I will show you that I have the strength – of a philosopher.
‘And what strength would that be?’ A will that never fails to get what it
wants, a faculty of aversion that always avoids what it dislikes,
proper impulse

So if you see someone pale with
nerves, be like a doctor who diagnoses liver trouble based on a
patient’s yellow skin. Say, ‘This man’s desire and aversion are
unhealthy, they aren’t functioning properly, they’re infected
