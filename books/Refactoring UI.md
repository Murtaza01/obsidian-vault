small border radios is natural, doesn't communicate much
large border radius starts to feel more playful
no border radius at all feels a lot more serious or formal

> colors

Gold might say “expensive” and “sophisticated”
Pink is a bit more fun, and not so serious
Blue is safe and familiar — nobody ever complains about blue

True black tends to look pretty unnatural, so start with a really dark grey

The darkest shade of a color is usually reserved for text, while the lightest
shade might be used to tint the background of an element.

using dark colored text on a lighter background (of the same color) might be very good

> text

• A dark color for primary content (like the headline of an article)
• A grey for secondary content (like the date an article was published)
• A lighter grey for tertiary content (maybe the copyright notice in a
footer)

> hierarchy 

the main action should have the color (it should be clear and vivid)
the secondary action should have a outline (no color or reduced color)
the third action (the least important) should have the least styles
