\head{The Problem}

\subhead{Dogma}

Dogma is any belief that is considered to be absolutely true.
Such believes leaves no possibility of reform and improve. Dogma
is the opposite of science: it encourages growth and
is evidence-based. Dogma causes \textbf{tension of the soul}, especially
in religion, it suppresses instincts and label them as 'sinful',
causing shame and guilt. The believer enters an internal fight,
where he tries to balance between his absolute believes and 
his instincts. 

\subhead{Passive Nihilism}

When we cut heroine on an addict, he immediately experiences 
withdraw symptoms. This is what happens when we take religion
from people. They start to experience passive nihilism, because
religion is so rooted in tradition and culture. If we were to 
take religion out of the equation, we must provide an alternative,
something that satisfy the spiritual need of the human soul.

\subhead{Christianity is Platonism for the masses}

Plato believed that there is two worlds: the imperfect -- our world -- which is just an imitation and preparation of the other world,
and the perfect -- the forms. Similarly, Christianity believes 
of the finite life as a temporary test to human beings and the
afterlife as eternal. Both these views devalue life over the life
after, making the 'other' life as the ultimate goal of existence.
Plato believed that the body is the prison of the soul.
