When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The
people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful,
arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this
because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the
beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized
that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of
the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a
share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one
can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my
relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like
feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and
lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at
someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.[1]

These are the words of Marcus Aurelius, an ancient greek emperor and philosopher knowing for one work only which is the Meditation, a personal dairy about his way of living, influenced by stoicism.

Stoicism is an ancient greek philosophy, its different from other philosophies by being more practical, its an ethical philosophy, concerning itself with what is good and what is bad, it teaches us how to live right, how to see the world as it is.

The ideas of stoicism is still relevant to our day and age, it is used in CBT (cogitative behavioral therapy) a form of talking therapy that is widely used in the modern age to help people live more happy life's 

In the opening section[2], Marcus mentions reminding ourselves of the fact that bad people exist, and that it is likely that we meet them and interact with them, they are bad he says, because of their ignorance.

Its not in our control whether they are bad or not, this is a fact about the world, that evil exist, but how we react to this evil is something under our control, this is one of the teaching of stoicism.

Throughout the book, Marcus always remind us of how we are related to one another, and how we are meant to work together like `feet,hands and eyes`  that we all share the same thing... being human.

Being human in Marcus eyes, is not an easy *job* (he consider being human is our duty), he has a very high standards of what human is and what he should and should not do, calling whoever cannot meet those standard an animal, not being in touch with his *logos*[3] or the mind

In essence whatever god-like[4] quality is considered more human and less animalistic, being merciful, understanding, in control of ones desires, in control of ones emotions, content and courageous...etc all are closer to what human is like to Marcus.

To the stoics[5] the only way to happiness is through virtue, being happy is only attainable through our good deeds, and good deeds are done without expecting anything back from people, that virtue being its own reward.

The book is a meditative journey of virtue, its different from other stoic books, being more accessible to the common people, and more reflective, it teaches us how to live a happy life.
