A sentence is a word or more that has a meaning, there is three types
of sentences:

+ simple sentences
+ compound 
+ complex

# simple sentences

A simple sentence is a single clause with a subject and a verb,
some examples:

he studies hard

it can have an object

he studies hard for the exam

> clause

A clause is a group of words that has a subject and a verb, it
falls below sentence in rank

# compound sentences

Consist of two or more clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions:
(and,but,or):

He studies hard but he doesn't have good grades 

# complex sentences

Consist of two or more clauses that are joined by using subordinating conjunctions
(because,when,before,that,which):

He studies hard because he wants good grades

the second clause is a dependent clause or secondary clause, 
meaning we cant remove the main caluse (he studies hard) without 
the sentecne losing its meaninig

> all other clauses are dependent in complex sentences

we can have one main clause that has 2 or more dependent
clauses
