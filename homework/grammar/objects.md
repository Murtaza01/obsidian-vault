Object are a way to describe where an action took place or on what thing.

The house being the object of the action cleaning.

# Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

There is two kind of verbs, verbs that come with objects:

```
He stole my bike.
She bought lunch.
```

These verbs are called **Transitive**

The other kind is **Intransitive** verbs, which they don't need objects:

```
I didn't eat.
She swim slowly.
```

# Indirect and Direct Objects

There is verbs that takes two objects, one is direct, the other is indirect.

```
She sent me a flower.
```

Me == is an indirect object.
Flower == is a direct object.

### Indirect objects

Usually they are a pronoun (me,she,her...) they are always the first,
with few exceptions.

They can be removed from the sentence because they are indirect:

```
She sent a flower.
```

> proposition

Indirect object can come with propositions, and that changes the order
of the indirect object to the end:

```
She sent a flower to me
```

Propositions add relation to sentences or rather extra information, this is
why we use them with indirect **only**.

### Direct objects

Direct object cannot be removed from the sentence, because they are the things
which the actions are describing:

```
I sent her a message.
```

The verb `sent` need the object message to complete its meaning.
