**Doctor Faustus**: Was born in Germany in Rhodes town,
from a humble origin, he Studied in Wittenberg university,
he was an orphan and was raised by kinsman, he mastered 
four branches of knowledge (theology, medicine, logic,
law)

**Q/ Discuss the view that Dr.Faustus represents the man who lived in the Renaissance**\?

Faustus sells his soul to the devil in order to get more
knowledge, he craved knowledge beyond the limits of 
humanity,this is the major theme of the renaissance; 
that humans are the greatest thing in the universe
and they can achieve anything.

**Q/ Define the chorus and what does it say about the play in the opening speech**\?

The Chorus are Group of people that provides information,
give the moral lesson, and set the scene of the play
to the audience,they are usually not part of the play.

In the play they mentions where did Faustus lived and 
what college did he went and his branches of knowledge 
and interest in black magic.

The Chorus appears three times in the play, in the 
beginning to provide information and set the scene
to the audience, in the middle to comment on the play, 
and in the end to give the moral lesson of the play.

**Q/ Show how Faustus left all Branches of knowledge and decided to follow black magic**\?

In the first scene we see Faustus inside his private 
room discussing his mastery of all the branches of 
knowledge, First he begins with logic,he says that
The aim of logic is to be a good debater, thus it is useless.
Secondly he turns to medicine, 
he says that the aim of medicine is health,
and humans cannot live eternally or bring back dead people,
so he says goodbye to medicine too. Thirdly theology
In the Bible there is contradiction, because 
in one place it says that the reward of sin is death, 
and in another it says that everyone will sin, so Faustus 
abandon the Bible too. Fourthly law, he say it is useless as
well, and after that he chooses black magic.

**Q/ What do good and evil angels stands for**\?

They are abstract characters that represent the inner
conflict of Faustus, good angel tries to make him follow 
the path of God, bad angel tries to make him follow black 
magic.

**Q/ What was Mephistophilis first description of hell and give its dramatic value**\?

After Faustus asks Mephistophilis about hell,
Mephistophilis tells him about Lucifer, how he 
was a favorite angel to God once but because of his 
pride and insolence he was dismissed from heaven and 
had become eternally damned in hell with the fallen angels.

Mephistophilis says that being deprived of Gods presence is
more tormenting than thousand hells.

**Q/ What was Mephistophilis second description of hell and give its dramatic value**\?

When Faustus asked Mephistophilis about hell for the second
time, Mephistophilis describe to him hell telling him 
that hell has no limits nor it is 
circumscribed to any place rather it is a state of 
being, which you experience when you are deprived of 
the presence of God, and that any place except heaven is
hell.

**Q/ Why did Mephistophilis refuse to bring Faustus a wife**\?

When Faustus asked Mephistophilis to bring him a wife
he refuses because marriage is a sacred vow,
it is a union blessed by God, and devils have nothing to do
with God, Mephistophilis instead tells
Faustus that he can have any woman he likes, be it as 
chaste as Penelope, or as wise as Queen of Sheba, or as
beautiful as Lucifer himself.

**Q/ Explain what happened to Faustus in Rome and what
is the dramatic significance of the scene of Faustus with
the Pope**\.

Faustus make fun of the pope by snatching his dish and 
make him look like a fool, the scene depicts the pope as 
cruel proud and power-mad person, Marlow intention was to 
please his protestant audience.

This scene shows how Faustus forgot about his noble 
purposes and pursue physical desires and trivial things.

**Q/ Show the dramatic significance of at the court
of Emperor Carolus the fifth**\?

The emperor Carolus asks Faustus to raise one of the
emperor's ancestor; Alexander the great and his Paramour,
Faustus tells him he cannot raise their actual bodies,
but spirits that resembles them, the emperor's knight makes
fun of Faustus ability and Faustus punish him by adding 
a pair of horns on his head, the emperor asks Faustus to
remove them, after that Mephistophilis enters with
Alexander and Paramour spirit, and the emperor reward 
Faustus.

This scene shows how Faustus forgot about his noble 
purposes and pursue physical desires and trivial things.

**Q/ Show the dramatic significance of the court of the
duke of Vanholt**\?

At the court of duke Vanholt, Faustus asks the duchess if
she desires any kind of food, and she request a dish 
of ripe grapes, although it is January, Mephistophilis 
goes and returns with a dish, the duke gets surprised.

This scene shows how Faustus forgot about his noble 
purposes and pursue physical desires and trivial things.

**Q/ What is the dramatic value of the appearance of 
Lucifer by himself to Faustus**\?

When Faustus experience great distress and conflict, he
start to think of repentance, he asks Christ to save 
his damned soul, Lucifer appears because Faustus has 
done great injury to Lucifer by mentioning the name of Christ,
and his action is a violation of the contract he made 
with the devil, Faustus promises Lucifer he won't ever
mention Christ or God again,then Lucifer displays a show 
for Faustus of the seven deadly sins to amuse him.

**Q/ What are the seven deadly sins, mention some of 
what each of them says about itself**\?

To divert Faustus attention from thinking of repentance,
Lucifer order a show of the seven deadly sins, where they
appear in front of him and talk about themselves, The 
First **Pride**, he says "I hate my parents and i can 
creep everywhere and that i won't say anything more unless
the room is perfumed". The Second **Covetousness**, he says "
I wish the house and all people turn into gold". The 
Thirdly **Wrath**, he says "I have nether a father or a
mother and i leapt from a lion's mouth when it was half 
an hour years old and from that time it carries 
its dagger in its hands and if it doesn't find someone 
to fight with it will fight with itself. The Fourth **Envy**,
it says "I cannot read therefore i wish all books to be burnt,
and when i see people eat i wish that a famine hits people". The Fifth 
**Gluttony**, it says "My parents left me nothing to eat but
only 30 meals a day". The Sixth **Sloth**, he says "I was born
on a sunny beach and i remind there, and i blame Faustus 
for ever waking me up". The last **Lechery** he says " the
first letter of my name is L". When Faustus saw the show
he says "O, this feeds my soul", this symbolize his hunger
for knowledge.

**Short answer (with less marks)**\:

Lucifer displays a show of the seven deadly sins
to divert Faustus attention from thinking of repentance and
to amuse him, it serve as a comic relieve for the audience.
The seven deadly sins are (Pride, Covetousness, Wrath, 
Envy, Gluttony, Sloth and Lechery), each sin appear
in front of Faustus and describe itself, after Faustus sees 
the show he says "O,this feeds my soul" symbolizing his
hunger for knowledge.

**Q/ What is the dramatic value of the appearance of the 
old man**\?

The old man is Faustus foil, he is physically ugly but
has a pure soul, whereas Faustus is beautiful 
but has an ugly soul,the old man serve as God's messenger
to guide Faustus into repentance, he refers to Christ blood
which contrast the blood that Faustus made a contract with.

Through the contrast between the hero and the foil we 
can see the weaknesses of the hero.

**Q/ Discuss the last hour in Faustus life**\?

In the last hour of his life Faustus has a monologue with
himself where he wishes that time would stop so that he
can save his soul. He wishes one drop of Christ blood or even
half a drop to save his soul. He wishes that the hills and
mountains would fall on him to hide him from God's anger.
When the clock strikes for half past the hour,
he wishes that god will shorten his time in hell for a
thousand year, or a hundred thousand years
but he knows that hell is eternal. He wishes that the 
reincarnation is real and that he will be an animal instead
of going to hell. He curses his parents, then himself, 
and finally Lucifer.

When the clock strikes midnight and thunder and lighting
scaring the skies, he cries aloud for his soul to dissolve
into the air so that the devil cannot find it, when the
devils enter Faustus begs God and the devil for mercy,
but the devils drags him away.

This is one of the most dramatic moment in the play, where 
Faustus tries to find a way out to redeem his soul but 
he finds no escape. This scene raises the question of why
Faustus last cries to Christ for mercy are not heard, 
in a truly Christian framework Faustus would be forgiven
even at the last moment, but Marlowe's play proves more 
tragic than Christian, and so there comes a point where
he is no longer can be saved, in other words he was damned
while he was still alive.

**Short answer (with less marks)**\:

In the last hour of his life Faustus wishes that if time could stop
so that he can save his soul, and that may God throw him
in hell for a thousand or hundred thousand years but not eternally,
and that the mountains could fall on him to hide him from God's anger.

In the last moments he begs God and Christ to save him but they 
do not hear him and the devils take him away, this scene shows 
Marlowe's play to be more tragic than Christian, because in Christianity
you would be forgiven even in the last moment.

## Q/ Comment on the following lines critically.

**Line 1/ O, this cheers my soul!**\.

Faustus says this line to Valdes and Cornelius, after
they told him on what black magic can do, that he no longer
need to study anything else and enrich him 
with all branches of knowledge, this is a reference to the
Renaissance the age of the hunger for knowledge.

**Line 2/ A sound magician is a demigod**\.

Faustus says this when he gets interested in black magic,
saying that a magician is like a God, who can do anything,
this was the turning point of Faustus from scholar 
to sorcerer.

**Line 3/ O, by aspiring pride and insolence**\.

Mephistophilis says this line to Faustus about Lucifer,
how he was an angel once and was kicked from heaven because
he challenged God, his arrogance and insolence caused
him to be sent to hell.

**Line 4/ This word "damnation" terrifies not him**\.

Faustus says this line to Mephistophilis after he abjure
God and the holy book, he tells Mephistophilis that he is not 
afraid to be damned (sent to hell) and willing to continue 
to sell his soul to Lucifer.

**Line 5/ The reward of sin is death; that's hard**\.

Said by Faustus when he was discussing the uselessness of
all branches of knowledge and he arrives at theology.

Faustus reads the bible and finds a contradiction, in one
place it says the reward of sin is death, in another that
we all sin, Faustus wonders why God created us to go to 
hell,because of this he abandons theology.

**Line 6/ The God thou serv'st is thine own apatite**\.

Faustus says this line after he hears a voice that tells 
him to abandon black magic and turn to God, Faustus says that
God doesn't love him, and that the god he serve is his own desires
and pleasures.

**Line 7/ Had not sweet pleasure conquer'd deep despair**\.

This line is said by Faustus after having doubt to 
leave black magic and repent to God, he realizes that 
his soul is damned and he starts to think of 
suicide but his pleasure beats his despair,
turning to physical desires for relieve from the despair 
he is in, Faustus had many chances to repeat but his 
temptation always wins.

**Line 8/ I do repent, and yet I do despair**\.

This line is said by Faustus after the old man tried to help him
to repent and save his soul while he still have time,
Faustus says that he wants to repent but his despair is too 
great to let him do it. He says this because when we are desperate the devils
are stronger and we are easily drawn to their temptations.

**Line 9/ Let Faustus live in hell a thousand years,**\
**A hundred thousand, and at last be sav'd**\!

This line is said by Faustus during the last hour of his
life, he wishes to lives a thousand years in hell
and then be purged of his sin instead of living eternally 
there. However it is only a wish because Faustus sold his 
soul to the devil in exchange of 24 years of magical power.

**Line 10/ O,I'll leap up to my God!--Who pulls me down?**\
**Where is it now? 'tis gone: and see where God**\
**stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows**\!

These lines are said by Faustus during the last hour
of his life, he says that he will pray to god to forgive him
but something holds him down, his sins. Faustus pleads for
one drop of Christ blood, or even half a drop to save his 
soul, then he says "O, spare me Lucifer" which causes the 
anger of God, despite God's anger, God still offers his hand
to Faustus for repentance, yet Faustus doesn't.

**Line 11/ But mercy, Faustus, of thy Saviour sweet**\
**Whose blood alone must wash away thy guilt**\.

Theis line is said by the old man when he was trying
to guide Faustus into repentance, he tells him that Christ is merciful
and that his blood can wash away his sins and saves his soul.

## Q/ Identify, comment and give the dramatic value of the following extract (quotation).

**Quote 1/ These metaphysics of magicians**\
**And necromantic books are heavenly;**\
**Lines, circles, scenes, letters, and characters;**\
**Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires**\.

These lines are said by Faustus after Faustus realizes 
that all branches of knowledge are useless, Faustus 
takes interest in necromantic books saying that 
those books are heavenly which is an irony because 
they are devilish.

**Quote 2/ O Faustus lay that damned book aside**\
**And Gaze not on it lest it tempt they soul**\
**and heap God's heavy wrath upon they head**\
**Read, read the scriptures: that is blasphemy**\.

These lines are said by Good Angel after Faustus 
interest in black magic,Good angel warn Faustus to leave 
necromantic books aside,because it corrupts the soul 
and that God will punish him for it, and read the holy 
books instead.

Good Angel is an abstract character that represent the good in Faustus

**Quote 3/ Go Forward Faustus, in that famous art**\
**Wherein all nature's treasure is contain'd:**\
**Be thou on earth as Jove is in the sky,**\
**Lord and commander of these elements**\.

These lines are said by Evil Angel after Faustus gets interested
in black magic, Evil Angel encourages Faustus to take black magic,
he seduced him with the great that comes from it,
telling him he will become like a God (like Jove, which is
a name for Roman God).

Evil Angel is an abstract character that represent the evil in Faustus.

**Quote 4/ I'll have them wall all Germany with brass,**\
**And make swift Rhine circle fair Wittenberg;**\
**I'll have them fill the public schools with silk,**\
**wherewith the students shall be bravely clad**\
**I'll levy soldiers with the coin they bring,**\
**And chase the Prince of Parma from our land,**\.

These lines are said by Faustus when he was waiting for Valdes and Cornelius,
Faustus is saying his 4 noble purposes when he gets his 
magic powers; First he will build a wall around Germany to protect it.
Second he will make the river *Rhine* circle around Wittenberg university.
Third he will make the students wear silk in public schools.
Fourth he will make a campaign of military to kick the Prince of Parma.

Though when Faustus got his power he pursued physical 
desires and trivial things.

**Quote 5/ Both law and physic are for petty wits;**\
**Divinity is basest of the three,**\
**unpleasant, harsh, contemptible, and vile:**\
**'Tis magic, magic that hath ravish'd me**\.

These lines are said by Faustus, when he was talking to Valdes and Cornelius,
Faustus says that both law and physics is useless, and that 
theology is even more useless, its magic that interest him and give him delight, 
the repetition of the word "magic" mark his definite decision to pursue necromancy.

**Quote 6/ I charge thee to return and change thy shape;**\
**Thou art too ugly to attend on me:**\
**Go and return an old Franciscan friar;**\
**That holy shape becomes a devil best**\.

These lines are said by Faustus, after Faustus preformed necromancy, 
Faustus tells these lines to Mephistophilis,
at his first appearance, he was too ugly so Faustus ordered
him to change his appearance and take the shape of a priest,
This is symbolic to the fact that some clergymen (priests)
are hypocrites (pretending goodness while they are evil inside).

**Quote 7/ That was the cause but yet per accidents:**\
**For, when we hear one rack the name of God,**\
**Abjure the Scriptures and his Saviour Christ,**\
**We fly, in hope to get his glorious soul;**\
**Nor will we come, unless he use such means**\.

These lines are said by Mephistophilis, after Faustus asked if he was the
one who conjured him, Mephistophilis answers that when devils hear someone
curse the name of God and abjure him, they fly to him
happily to get his "glorious soul", an irony because 
the person soul will be damned.

**Quote 8/ Why this is hell, nor am I out of it:**\
**Think'st thou that I, who saw the face of God,**\
**And tasted the eternal joys of heaven,**\
**Am not tormented with ten thousands hells,**\
**In being depriv'd of everlasting bliss?**\
**Oh Faustus, leave these frivolous demands**\
**Which strike a terror to my fainting soul**\!

These lines are said by Mephistophilis to Faustus, when
Faustus asks him why he consider himself in hell 
when he can move freely, Mephistophilis answers him that 
when he was an angel once he tasted God's presence, 
but he was kicked out with Satan, and he feels its
more tormenting than a thousand hells. We can conclude
that every place which is not heaven is hell.

**Quote 9/ Of wealth !**\

**When Mephistophilis shall stand by me**\
**What God can hurt thee, Faustus? Thou art safe.**\

conflict to leave black magic, Faustus is convinced by 
Evil Angel to stay in necromancy, leaving his spirit and turning to his 
physical desires, wanting to rule over Emden city, and having Mephistophilis 
in his side he is safe from any God's harm.

**Quote 10/ Then, Faustus stab thine arm courageously**\
**And bind thy soul, that at some certain day**\
**Great Lucifer may claim it as his own**\
**And then be thou as great as Lucifer**\.

These lines are said by Mephistophilis, after Faustus agrees to give 
his soul to Lucifer, Mephistophilis tells Faustus that in order to gain Lucifer's
powers he has to give his soul to Lucifer, and sign a contract  using his blood
that he will get from stabbing his arm.

**Quote 11/ But what is this inscription on mine arm?**\
**Homo, fuge:whither should i fly?**\
**If unto God, he'll throw me down to hell.**\
**My senses are deceiv'd, here's nothing writ:-**\
**I see it plain; here in this place is writ,**\
**Homo, fuge: yet shall not Faustus fly**\.

These lines are said by Faustus,after Faustus blood congeals 
and Mephistophilis helps him clear it, Faustus sees an inscription on 
his arm that says "Homo,fuge" which means flee human, at first he thinks that his eyes
are deceiving him, but then he looks again and sees the inscription clearly,
he acknowledges that if he tries to flee to God, God will throw him in hell, so he ignore this
and continue to sign the contract with his blood.

**Quote 12/ Within the bowels of these elements,**\
**Where we are tortur'd and remain for ever:**\
**Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscrib'd**\
**in of self place; for where we are is hell**\
**And where hell is, there must we ever be**\:

These lines are said by Mephistophilis when Faustus asked
him about hell for the second time, Mephistophilis says that
hell has no limit nor it is circumscribed to any place,
rather it is a state of being where one is deprived of God's
presence, and any place that is not heaven is hell.

**Quote 13/ Marriage is but a ceremonial toy,**\
**And if thou lov'st me think no more of it.**\

**And bring them every morning to thy bed.**\
**She whom thine eye shall like, they heart shall have,**\
**Were she as chaste as was Penelope,**\
**As wise as Saba, or as beautiful**\
**As was bright Lucifer before his fall**\.

These lines are said by Mephistophilis, after Faustus 
commands Mephistophilis to fetch (bring) him a wife.
Mephistophilis refuses because marriage is sacred, 
it is a union blessed by God, and he as a devil doesn't 
accept that, instead of a wife  Mephistophilis tells 
Faustus that he can bring him any woman his heart desires,
be it Penelope which is a woman from Greek mythology 
who was known for her chastity, or the wise queen Saba,
or Lucifer himself when he was an angel.

**Quote 14/ His faith is great, I cannot touch his soul;**\
**But what I may afflict his body with**\
**I will attempt, which is but little worth**\.

These lines are said by Mephistophilis to Faustus after 
Faustus asked him to revenge the old man, who tried
to help Faustus and guide him, Mephistophilis tells him 
that he cannot hurt the old man pure spirit because 
he has a deep faith, he can only hurt his body which 
is insignificant.

**Quote 15/ Ay, stay, good Faustus, stay thy desperate steps!**\
**I see an angel hovers o'er thy head,**\
**And, with a vial full of precious grace,**\
**Offers to pour the same into thy soul:**\
**Then call for mercy, and avoid despair**\.

These lines are said by the old man to Faustus, when 
he was trying to guide him to repent and save his soul,
the old man represent God's infinite mercy. However Faustus
refuses his help and instead tells Mephistophilis to attack
him and summon up Helen of Troy to distract him.

**Quote 16/ Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight,**\
**And burned is Apollo's laurel-bough,**\
**That sometime grew within this learned man.**\
**Faustus is gone: regard his hellish fall,**\
**Whose fiendful fortune may exhort the wise,**\
**Only to wonder at unlawful things,**\
**Whose deepness doth entice such forward wits**\
**To practise more than heavenly power permits**\.

The chorus makes the final and closing comment on the fall
of Faustus, and the moral lesson of the play, they say that
Faustus tried to go beyond the limitation of humanity, and 
as a result he was damned. The chorus reminds the audience
