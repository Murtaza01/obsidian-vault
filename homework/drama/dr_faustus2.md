time, Mephistophilis describe to him hell telling him 
that hell has no limits nor it is 
circumscribed to any place rather it is a state of 
being, which you experience when you are deprived of 
the presence of God, and that any place except heaven is
hell.

**Q/ Why did Mephistophilis refuse to bring Faustus a wife**\?

When Faustus asked Mephistophilis to bring him a wife
he refuses because marriage is a sacred vow,
it is a union blessed by God, and devils have nothing to do
with God, Mephistophilis instead tells
Faustus that he can have any woman he likes, be it as 
chaste as Penelope, or as wise as Queen of Sheba, or as
beautiful as Lucifer himself.

Faustus make fun of the pope by snatching his dish and 
make him look like a fool, the scene depicts the pope as 
cruel proud and power-mad person, Marlow intention was to 
please his protestant audience.

fun of Faustus ability and Faustus punish him by adding 
a pair of horns on his head, the emperor asks Faustus to
remove them, after that Mephistophilis enters with
Alexander and Paramour spirit, and the emperor reward 
Faustus.

This scene shows how Faustus forgot about his noble 
purposes and pursue physical desires and trivial things.

she desires any kind of food, and she request a dish 
of ripe grapes, although it is January, Mephistophilis 
goes and returns with a dish, the duke gets surprised.

purposes and pursue physical desires and trivial things.

**Q/ What is the dramatic value of the appearance of 
Lucifer by himself to Faustus**\?

When Faustus experience great distress and conflict, he
start to think of repentance, he asks Christ to save 
his damned soul, Lucifer appears because Faustus has 
done great injury to Lucifer by mentioning the name of Christ,
and his action is a violation of the contract he made 
with the devil, Faustus promises Lucifer he won't ever
mention Christ or God again,then Lucifer displays a show 
for Faustus of the seven deadly sins to amuse him.

**Q/ What are the seven deadly sins, mention some of 
what each of them says about itself**\?

To divert Faustus attention from thinking of repentance,
Lucifer order a show of the seven deadly sins, where they
appear in front of him and talk about themselves, The 
First **Pride**, he says "I hate my parents and i can 
creep everywhere and that i won't say anything more unless
the room is perfumed". The Second **Covetousness**, he says "
I wish the house and all people turn into gold". The 
Thirdly **Wrath**, he says "I have nether a father or a
mother and i leapt from a lion's mouth when it was half 
an hour years old and from that time it carries 
its dagger in its hands and if it doesn't find someone 
to fight with it will fight with itself. The Fourth **Envy**,
it says "I cannot read therefore i wish all books to be burnt,
and when i see people eat i wish that a famine hits people". The Fifth 
**Gluttony**, it says "My parents left me nothing to eat but
only 30 meals a day". The Sixth **Sloth**, he says "I was born
on a sunny beach and i remind there, and i blame Faustus 
for ever waking me up". The last **Lechery** he says " the
first letter of my name is L". When Faustus saw the show
he says "O, this feeds my soul", this symbolize his hunger
for knowledge.

**Short answer (with less marks)**\:

Lucifer displays a show of the seven deadly sins
to divert Faustus attention from thinking of repentance and
to amuse him, it serve as a comic relieve for the audience.
The seven deadly sins are (Pride, Covetousness, Wrath, 
Envy, Gluttony, Sloth and Lechery), each sin appear
in front of Faustus and describe itself, after Faustus sees 
the show he says "O,this feeds my soul" symbolizing his
hunger for knowledge.

**Q/ What is the dramatic value of the appearance of the 
old man**\?

The old man is Faustus foil, he is physically ugly but
has a pure soul, whereas Faustus is beautiful 
but has an ugly soul,the old man serve as God's messenger
to guide Faustus into repentance, he refers to Christ blood
which contrast the blood that Faustus made a contract with.

Through the contrast between the hero and the foil we 
can see the weaknesses of the hero.

**Q/ Discuss the last hour in Faustus life**\?

In the last hour of his life Faustus has a monologue with
himself where he wishes that time would stop so that he
can save his soul. He wishes one drop of Christ blood or even
half a drop to save his soul. He wishes that the hills and
mountains would fall on him to hide him from God's anger.
When the clock strikes for half past the hour,
he wishes that god will shorten his time in hell for a
thousand year, or a hundred thousand years
but he knows that hell is eternal. He wishes that the 
reincarnation is real and that he will be an animal instead
of going to hell. He curses his parents, then himself, 
and finally Lucifer.

When the clock strikes midnight and thunder and lighting
scaring the skies, he cries aloud for his soul to dissolve
into the air so that the devil cannot find it, when the
devils enter Faustus begs God and the devil for mercy,
but the devils drags him away.

This is one of the most dramatic moment in the play, where 
Faustus tries to find a way out to redeem his soul but 
he finds no escape. This scene raises the question of why
Faustus last cries to Christ for mercy are not heard, 
in a truly Christian framework Faustus would be forgiven
even at the last moment, but Marlowe's play proves more 
tragic than Christian, and so there comes a point where
he is no longer can be saved, in other words he was damned
while he was still alive.

**Short answer (with less marks)**\:

In the last hour of his life Faustus wishes that time will stop
so that he can save his soul, and that may God throw him
in hell for a thousand or hundred thousand years but not eternally,
and that the mountains could fall on him to hide him from God's anger.

In the last moments he begs God and Christ to save him but they 
do not hear him and the devils take him away, this scene shows 
Marlowe's play to be more tragic than Christian, because in Christianity
you would be forgiven even in the last moment.

## Q/ Comment on the following lines critically.

**Line 7/ Had not sweet pleasure conquer'd deep despair**\.

This line is said by Faustus after having doubt to 
leave black magic and repent to God, he realizes that 
his soul is damned and he starts to think of 
suicide but his pleasure beats his despair,
turning to physical desires for relieve from the despair 
he is in, Faustus had many chances to repeat but his 
temptation always wins.

**Line 8/ I do repent, and yet I do despair**\.

This line is said by Faustus after the old man tried to help him
to repent and save his soul while he still have time,
Faustus says that he wants to repent but his despair is too 
great to let him do it. He says this because when we are desperate the devils
are stronger and we are easily drawn to their temptations.

**Line 9/ Let Faustus live in hell a thousand years,**\
**A hundred thousand, and at last be sav'd**\!

This line is said by Faustus during the last hour of his
life, he wishes to lives a thousand years in hell
and then be purged of his sin instead of living eternally 
there. However it is only a wish because Faustus sold his 
soul to the devil in exchange of 24 years of magical power.

**Line 10/ O,I'll leap up to my God!--Who pulls me down?**\
**Where is it now? 'tis gone: and see where God**\
**stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows**\!

These lines are said by Faustus during the last hour
of his life, he says that he will pray to god to forgive him
but something holds him down, his sins. Faustus pleads for
one drop of Christ blood, or even half a drop to save his 
soul, then he says "O, spare me Lucifer" which causes the 
anger of God, despite God's anger, God still offers his hand
to Faustus for repentance, yet Faustus doesn't.

## Q/ Identify, comment and give the dramatic value of the following extract (quotation).

**Quote 11/ Within the bowels of these elements,**\
**Where we are tortur'd and remain for ever:**\
**Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscrib'd**\
**in of self place; for where we are is hell**\
**And where hell is, there must we ever be**\:

These lines are said by Mephistophilis when Faustus asked
him about hell for the second time, Mephistophilis says that
hell has no limit nor it is circumscribed to any place,
rather it is a state of being where one is deprived of God's
presence, and any place that is not heaven is hell.

**Quote 12/ Marriage is but a ceremonial toy,**\
**And if thou lov'st me think no more of it.**\
**I'll cull thee out the fairest courtesans,**\
**And bring them every morning to thy bed.**\
**She whom thine eye shall like, they heart shall have,**\
**Were she as chaste as was Penelope,**\
**As wise as Saba, or as beautiful**\
**As was bright Lucifer before his fall**\.

These lines are said by Mephistophilis, after Faustus 
commands Mephistophilis to fetch (bring) him a wife.
Mephistophilis refuses because marriage is sacred, 
it is a union blessed by God, and he as a devil doesn't 
accept that, instead of a wife  Mephistophilis tells 
Faustus that he can bring him any woman his heart desires,
be it Penelope which is a woman from Greek mythology 
who was known for her chastity, or the wise queen Saba,
or Lucifer himself when he was an angel.

**Quote 13/ His faith is great, I cannot touch his soul;**\
**But what I may afflict his body with**\
**I will attempt, which is but little worth**\.

These lines are said by Mephistophilis to Faustus after 
Faustus asked him to revenge the old man, who tried
to help Faustus and guide him, Mephistophilis tells him 
that he cannot hurt the old man pure spirit because 
he has a deep faith, he can only hurt his body which 
is insignificant.

**Quote 14/ Ay, stay, good Faustus, stay thy desperate steps!**\
**I see an angel hovers o'er thy head,**\
**And, with a vial full of precious grace,**\
**Offers to pour the same into thy soul:**\
**Then call for mercy, and avoid despair**\.

These lines are said by the old man to Faustus, when 
he was trying to guide him to repent and save his soul,
the old man represent God's infinite mercy. However Faustus
refuses his help and instead tells Mephistophilis to attack
him and summon up Helen of Troy to distract him.

**Quote 15/ Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight,**\
**And burned is Apollo's laurel-bough,**\
**That sometime grew within this learned man.**\
**Faustus is gone: regard his hellish fall,**\
**Whose fiendful fortune may exhort the wise,**\
**Only to wonder at unlawful things,**\
**Whose deepness doth entice such forward wits**\
**To practise more than heavenly power permits**\.

The chorus makes the final and closing comment on the fall
of Faustus, and the moral lesson of the play, they say that
Faustus tried to go beyond the limitation of humanity, and 
as a result he was damned. The chorus reminds the audience
to learn from Faustus and respect the limits of things, and
to express the medieval idea that Faustus fall was a result 
of his pride and ambition.
