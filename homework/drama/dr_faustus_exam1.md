title: Doctor Faustus
author: Christopher Marlowe
---
**Doctor Faustus**: Was born in Germany in Rhodes town,
from a humble origin, he Studied in Wittenberg university,
he was an orphan and was raised by kinsman, he mastered 
four branches of knowledge (theology, medicine, logic,
philosophy)

**Q/ Discuss the view that Dr.Faustus represents the man who lived in the Renaissance**\?

Faustus sells his soul to the devil in order to get more
knowledge, he craved knowledge beyond the limits of 
humanity,this is the major theme of the Renaissance; 
that humans are the greatest thing in the universe
and they can achieve anything.

**Q/ Define the chorus and what does it say about the play in the opening speech**\?

The Chorus: Group of people that provides information and  
set the scene to the audience about the play, they are 
usually not part of the play.

In Dr.Faustus it mentions where he is from and what school
he went and his interest in black magic.

**Q/ Show how Faustus left all Branches of knowledge and decided to follow black magic?**
* Logic And Philosophy: The aim of logic is to be a good 
debater, thus it offers no greater miracle.

* Medicine: The aim of of medicine is body health,
and humans cannot live eternally or give dead people life,
so he says goodbye to medicine too.

* Theology: In the Bible there is contradiction, because 
in one place it says that the reward of sin is death, 
and in another it says that everyone will sin, so Faustus 
abandon the Bible too.

**Q/ What do good and evil angels stands for**\?

They are abstract characters that represent the inner
conflict of Faustus, good angel tries to make him follow 
the path of god, bad angel tries to make him follow black 
magic.


**Q/ What was Mephistophilis first description of hell and give its dramatic value**\?

After Faustus asks Mephistophilis about hell,
Mephistophilis tells him about Lucifer, how he 
was a favorite angel to god once but because of his 
pride and insolence he was dismissed from heaven and 
had become eternally damned in hell with the fallen angels.

Mephistophilis says that being deprived of gods presence is
more tormenting than thousand hells.

### Q/ Comment on the following lines critically.

**Comment 1/ O, this cheers my soul!**\.

Faustus says this line to Valdes and Cornelius, after
they told him on what black magic can do, that he no longer
need to study anything else and enrich him 
with all branches of knowledge, this is a reference to the
Renaissance the age of the hunger for knowledge.

**Comment 2/ A sound magician is a demigod**\.

Faustus says this when he gets interested in black magic,
saying that a magician is like a god, who can do anything,
this was the turning point of Faustus from scholar 
to sorcerer.

**Comment 3/ O, by aspiring pride and insolence**\.

Mephistophilis says this line to Faustus about Lucifer,
how he was an angel once and was kicked from heaven because
he challenged God, his arrogance and insolence caused
him to be sent to hell.

**Comment 4/ This word "damnation" terrifies not him**\.

Faustus says this line to Mephistophilis after he abjure
god and the holy book, he tells Mephistophilis that he is not 
afraid to be damned (sent to hell) and willing to continue 
to sell his soul to Lucifer.

**Comment 5/ The reward of sin is death: that's hard**\.

Said by Faustus when he was discussing the uselessness of
all branches of knowledge and he arrives at theology.

Faustus reads the bible and finds a contradiction, in one
place it says the reward of sin is death, in another that
we all sin, Faustus wonders why god created us to go to 
hell,because of this he abandons theology.

**Comment 6/ The god thou serv'st is thine own apatite**\.

Faustus says this line after he hears a voice that tells 
him to abandon black magic and turn to god, Faustus says that
god doesn't love him, and that the god he serve is his own desires
and pleasures.

**Quote 4/ I'll have them wall all Germany with brass,**\
**And make swift Rhine circle fair Wittenberg;**\
**I'll have them fill the public schools with silk,**\
**wherewith the students shall be bravely clad**\
**I'll levy soldiers with the coin they bring,**\
**And chase the Prince of Parma from our land,**\.

Said by: Faustus\
Scene 1\
When he was waiting for Valdes and Cornelius.

Faustus is saying his 4 noble purposes when he gets his 
magic powers which are:

- Build a wall around Germany to protect it.
- Make the river *Rhine* circle around Wittenberg university.
- Make the students wear silk in public schools.
- Make a campaign of military to kick the Prince of Parma.

Though when Faustus got his power he pursued physical 
desires and trivial things.

**Quote 5/ Both law and physic are for petty wits;**\
**Divinity is basest of the three,**\
**unpleasant, harsh, contemptible, and vile:**\
**'Tis magic, magic that hath ravish'd [^1] me**\.

Said By: Faustus.\
Scene 1\
When he was talking to Valdes and Cornelius.

Faustus says that both law and physics are useless, and that 
theology are even more useless, its magic that interest him and give him delight.

Scene 3\
After Faustus preformed necromancy.

Faustus tells these lines to Mephistophilis (the devil),
at his first appearance, he was too ugly so Faustus ordered
him to change his appearance and take the shape of a priest.

This is symbolic to the fact that some clergymen (priests)
are hypocrites (pretending goodness while they are evil inside).

**For, when we hear one rack the name of God,**\
**Abjure the Scriptures and his Saviour Christ,**\

**Nor will we come, unless he use such means**\.


Said by: Mephistophilis.\
Scene 3\
After Faustus asked if he was the one who conjured him.

Mephistophilis answers that when devils hear someone
curse the name of god and abjure him, they fly to him
happily to get his "glorious soul", an irony because 
the person soul will be damned.

**Quote 8/ Of wealth !**\
**Why, the signiory of Emden shall be mine.**\

Said by: Faustus\
Scene 5\

**Homo, fuge:whither should i fly?**\
**If unto God, he'll throw me down to hell.**\
**My senses are deceiv'd, here's nothing writ:-**\
**I see it plain; here in this place is writ,**\
**Homo, fuge: yet shall not Faustus fly.**\

Said by: Faustus\
Scene 5\
After Faustus blood congeals and Mephistophilis helps him clear it.

Faustus sees an inscription on his arm "Home,fuge"
