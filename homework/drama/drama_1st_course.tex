\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Faustus}
Was born in Germany in Rhodes town, from a humble origin. He
Studied in Wittenberg university, he was an orphan and was raised by kinsman,
he mastered four branches of knowledge (theology, medicine, logic, law).

\subhead{Identify, comment and give the dramatic value of the
following quotations.}

\quotehead{Quote 1/
These metaphysics of magicians\\
And necromantic books are heavenly;\\
Lines, circles, scenes, letters, and characters;\\
Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires.
}{Quote 1}

These lines are said by Faustus after Faustus realizes that all branches of knowledge 
are useless. Faustus takes interest in necromantic books saying that those
books are heavenly which is an irony because they are devilish.

\subhead{Comment on the following lines critically.}

\quotehead{Line 1/ O, this cheers my soul!}{Line 1}

Faustus says this line to Valdes and Cornelius, after they told him on what black
magic can do, that he no longer need to study anything else and enrich him with
all branches of knowledge, this is a reference to the Renaissance the age of the
hunger for knowledge.

\subhead{General Questions}

\subsubhead{Question 1: Discuss the view that Dr.Faustus represents the man who lived in the
Renaissance?}

Faustus sells his soul to the devil in order to get more knowledge, he craved
knowledge beyond the limits of humanity. This is the major theme of the renaissance;
that humans are the greatest thing in the universe and they can achieve
anything.

\subhead{Give very short answers to the following questions.}

\subsubhead{Q/ What did Faustus asked Mephistophilis to do when the latter appeared to
him for the first time?}

Change his shape to a priest.
