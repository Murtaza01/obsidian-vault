\subsection*{\centering{Identify, comment and give the dramatic value of the following quotation.}}

\subsubsection*{Quote 1/
  If music be the food of love, play on;\\
	Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,\\
	The appetite may sicken, and so die.\\
	That strain again! it had a dying fall:\\
	O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south,\\
	That breathes upon a bank of violets,\\
	Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:\\
	'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.\\
	O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,\\
	That, notwithstanding thy capacity	10\\
	Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,\\
	Of what validity and pitch soe'er,\\
	But falls into abatement and low price,\\
	Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy\\
	That it alone is high fantastical.
}
These lines are said by Duke Orsino  in the opening speech. He suffers because
his love to Countess Olivia is one sided. He depicts love as an "appetite" that
he cannot fulfill. He thinks that music may help feed his appetite, comparing
it to wind that comes over flowers and steals the odor. However he does not
enjoy it like before because he is love sick. He uses apostrophe to address the spirit of love
describing it as fresh, beautiful and quick but degrading, that when you
love someone you must forget about your dignity.

\subsubsection*{Quote 2/ 
  So please my lord. I might not be addmited\\ 
  But from her handmaid do return this answer:\\
  The element itself, till seven years' heat, \\
  Shall not behold her face at ample view;\\ 
  But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,\\ 
  And water once a day her chamber round \\ 
  With eye-offending brine---all this to season\\
  A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh\\
  And lasting in her sad remembrance.
}

These lines are said by Valentine (Orsino's messenger) after he went
to Olivia. He bring a message from Olivia handmaiden that she will 
continue to mourn her dead brother and live like a nun without the 
society of men for seven years. Walking in veil and watering her 
chamber once a day to keep her brother's memory.

\subsubsection*{Quote 3/
  O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame\\
  To pay this debt of love but to a brother,\\
	How will she love, when the rich golden shaft\\
	Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else\\
	That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,\\
	These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd\\
	Her sweet perfections with one self king!
}

These lines are said by Orisno to Valentine when Valentine told him
about Olivia decision to leave the society of men and mourn over her
dead brother for seven years. Orisno consider this an act of nobility and
loyalty and gets more attracted to Olivia. He wonders if she loves her
dead brother this much, how much love she would give to a husband who 
will sit like king on her three thrones: liver, brain, heart.

\subsubsection*{Quote 4/
  True, Madam. And, to comfort you with chance,\\
  Assure yourself, after our ship did split,\\
	When you and those poor number saved with you	\\
	Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,\\
	Most provident in peril, bind himself,\\
	Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,\\
	To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;\\
	Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,\\
	I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves\\
	So long as I could see.
}

These lines are said by the Captain who saved Viola after the shipwreck.
He is loyal and native of Illyria, he gives Viola money and cloths and
advice to find work with Orsino. He also assures her that her brother 
(Sebastian) is still alive and he saw 
him fighting the waves courageously like Arion. Arion is a poet in Greek
mythology who was thrown in the sea and because of his lyre the dolphins
were charmed and saved him.

\subsubsection*{Quote 5/
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,\\
And though that nature with a beauteous wall\\
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee\\
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits\\
With this thy fair and outward character.\\
I prithee—and I’ll pay thee bounteously—\\
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid\\
For such disguise as haply shall become\\
The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke.
}

These words are said by Viola to the captain of the ship who saved her
from shipwreck and helped her find work. Viola praise the captain 
honorable behavior and says that beauty is 
sometimes misleading for some may be beautiful outside but ugly inside.
However she says that the captain is beautiful both inside and outside.
Voila then offers to pay him in order to conceal her identity and be in
disguise to be the Duke's servant.

\subsubsection*{Quote 6/
O, then unfold the passion of my love.\\
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith.\\
It shall become thee well to act my woes.\\
She will attend it better in thy youth\\
Than in a nuncio’s of more grave aspect.
}

These words are said by Duke Orisno to Viola disguised as Cesario.
Viola has earned the Duke's trust within few days, so he send her to 
Countess Olivia to confess his love for Olivia and how much he is 
suffering because of it. The Duke thinks that Viola feminine look and 
her being young will help to persuade Olivia.

\subsubsection*{Quote 7/
I’ll do my best\\
To woo your lady. [Aside]. Yet a barful strife!\\
Whoe’er I woo, myself would be his wife.
}

These words are said by Viola (Cesario) after Duke Orsino asks her
to confess his love for Olivia. She says she will do her best. However
she says aside (only to herself and the audience) that it is hard for
her because she is in love with the Duke and has to convince another 
woman to marry him. This shows that Voila is a noble and loyal
person to Orsino because he treated her as a friend not a servant.
