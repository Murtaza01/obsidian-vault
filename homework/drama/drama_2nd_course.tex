\subsection*{\centering{Identify, comment and give the dramatic value of the following quotation.}}

\subsubsection*{Quote 1/
  If music be the food of love, play on;\\
	Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,\\
	The appetite may sicken, and so die.\\
	That strain again! it had a dying fall:\\
	O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south,\\
	That breathes upon a bank of violets,\\
	Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:\\
	'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.\\
	O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,\\
	That, notwithstanding thy capacity	10\\
	Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,\\
	Of what validity and pitch soe'er,\\
	But falls into abatement and low price,\\
	Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy\\
	That it alone is high fantastical.
}
These lines are said by Duke Orsino  in the opening speech. He suffers because
his love to Countess Olivia is one sided. He depicts love as an "appetite" that
he cannot fulfill. He thinks that music may help feed his appetite, comparing
it to wind that comes over flowers and steals the odor. However he does not
enjoy it like before because he is love sick. He uses apostrophe to address the spirit of love
describing it as fresh, beautiful and quick but degrading, that when you
love someone you must forget about your dignity.

\subsubsection*{Quote 2/ 
  So please my lord. I might not be addmited\\ 
  But from her handmaid do return this answer:\\
  The element itself, till seven years' heat, \\
  Shall not behold her face at ample view;\\ 
  But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,\\ 
  And water once a day her chamber round \\ 
  With eye-offending brine---all this to season\\
  A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh\\
  And lasting in her sad remembrance.
}

These lines are said by Valentine (Orsino's messenger) after he went
to Olivia. He bring a message from Olivia handmaiden that she will 
continue to mourn her dead brother and live like a nun without the 
society of men for seven years. Walking in veil and watering her 
chamber once a day to keep her brother's memory.

\subsubsection*{Quote 3/
  O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame\\
  To pay this debt of love but to a brother,\\
	How will she love, when the rich golden shaft\\
	Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else\\
	That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,\\
	These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd\\
	Her sweet perfections with one self king!
}

These lines are said by Orisno to Valentine when Valentine told him
about Olivia decision to leave the society of men and mourn over her
dead brother for seven years. Orisno consider this an act of nobility and
loyalty and gets more attracted to Olivia. He wonders if she loves her
dead brother this much, how much love she would give to a husband who 
will sit like king on her three thrones: liver, brain, heart.

\subsubsection*{Quote 4/
  True, Madam. And, to comfort you with chance,\\
  Assure yourself, after our ship did split,\\
	When you and those poor number saved with you	\\
	Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,\\
	Most provident in peril, bind himself,\\
	Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,\\
	To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;\\
	Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,\\
	I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves\\
	So long as I could see.
}

These lines are said by the Captain who saved Viola after the shipwreck.
He is loyal and native of Illyria, he gives Viola money and cloths and
advice to find work with Orsino. He also assures her that her brother 
(Sebastian) is still alive and he saw 
him fighting the waves courageously like Arion. Arion is a poet in Greek
mythology who was thrown in the sea and because of his lyre the dolphins
were charmed and saved him.

\subsubsection*{Quote 5/
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,\\
And though that nature with a beauteous wall\\
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee\\
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits\\
With this thy fair and outward character.\\
I prithee—and I’ll pay thee bounteously—\\
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid\\
For such disguise as haply shall become\\
The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke.
}

These words are said by Viola to the captain of the ship who saved her
from shipwreck and helped her find work. Viola praise the captain 
honorable behavior and says that beauty is 
sometimes misleading for some may be beautiful outside but ugly inside.
However she says that the captain is beautiful both inside and outside.
Voila then offers to pay him in order to conceal her identity and be in
disguise to be the Duke's servant.

\subsubsection*{Quote 6/
O, then unfold the passion of my love.\\
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith.\\
It shall become thee well to act my woes.\\
She will attend it better in thy youth\\
Than in a nuncio’s of more grave aspect.
}

These words are said by Duke Orisno to Viola disguised as Cesario.
Viola has earned the Duke's trust within few days, so he send her to 
Countess Olivia to confess his love for Olivia and how much he is 
suffering because of it. The Duke thinks that Viola feminine look and 
her being young will help to persuade Olivia.

\subsubsection*{Quote 7/
I’ll do my best\\
To woo your lady. [Aside]. Yet a barful strife!\\
Whoe’er I woo, myself would be his wife.
}

These words are said by Viola (Cesario) after Duke Orsino asks her
to confess his love for Olivia. She says she will do her best. However
she says aside (only to herself and the audience) that it is hard for
her because she is in love with the Duke and has to convince another 
woman to marry him. This shows that Voila is a noble and loyal
person to Orsino because he treated her as a friend not a servant.

\subsubsection*{Quote 8/
Your lord does know my mind. I cannot love him.\\
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,\\
Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;\\
In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant,\\
And in dimension and the shape of nature\\
A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.\\
He might have took his answer long ago.
}

These words are said by Countess Olivia to Viola disguised as Cesario.
Olivia acknowledges that the Duke Orsino is rich, noble, educated, brave 
and attractive. Yet she cannot love him because love is connected with
the souls. The Duke should have forgotten about her and stopped trying 
to win her love.

\subsubsection*{Q/ Discuss Countess Olivia's Soliloquy after she met
Cesario and fell in his admiration.}

\subsubsection*{Quote 9/
“Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.\\
I am a gentleman.” I’ll be sworn thou art.\\
Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit\\
Do give thee fivefold blazon. Not too fast! Soft,soft!\\
Unless the master were the man. How now?\\
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?\\
Methinks I feel this youth’s perfections\\
With an invisible and subtle stealth\\
To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.—\\
What ho, Malvolio!
}

These words are said by Countess Olivia to herself after she met Cesario
and fell in his admiration. She asks him about his origin because she
thought he looks more than a messenger. She says that his face, tongue, 
speech and behaviors all show that he is a gentleman. Then she blames
herself for falling in love so quickly and compare it to the plague. 
She confesses the perfection of this young man has crept and penetrate
her heart. Then she surrenders to fate and says "let it be". This is
against the tendency of sixteenth century belief that man can make his own
fate. We see that her decision for mourning for seven years has gone
with the wind. Then She invents the story of the ring and give it to 
Molvolio to ensure Cesario coming back.

\subsubsection*{Q/ Discuss Viola's Soliloquy after she receives a ring
from Countess Olivia given her by Molvolio.}

\subsubsection*{Quote 10/
I left no ring with her. What means this lady?\\
She picks up the ring.\\
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her!\\
She made good view of me, indeed so much\\
That methought her eyes had lost her tongue,\\
For she did speak in starts distractedly.\\
She loves me, sure! The cunning of her passion\\
Invites me in this churlish messenger.\\
None of my lord’s ring? Why, he sent her none!\\
I am the man. If it be so, as ’tis,\\
Poor lady, she were better love a dream.\\
Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness\\
Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.\\
How easy is it for the proper false\\
In women’s waxen hearts to set their forms!\\
Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we,\\
For such as we are made of, such we be.\\
How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,\\
And I, poor monster, fond as much on him,\\
And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.\\
What will become of this? As I am man,\\
My state is desperate for my master’s love.\\
As I am woman (now, alas the day!),\\
What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!\\
O Time, thou must untangle this, not I.\\
It is too hard a knot for me t’ untie.
}

These words are said by Viola after she receives a ring from Countess 
Olivia given her by Molvolio. Viola shockingly says that she didn't leave 
a ring and conclude that it is the cunning of Olivia and that she 
might have fallen in love with her not knowing that Viola (Cesario),
is a woman disguised as a man. Viola says that it was clear from Olivia 
face and voice that she is attracted to her. Then she condemns her
"Disguise" as if it was a person. She describes woman as having waxen
hearts that the deceivers can easily set their darts and penetrate them.
Then she refers to the triangle of complication. She is in love with
Orsino and Orisno loves Olivia and Olivia loves her. She say that 
only fate can untie this.
