**Doctor Faustus**: Was born in Germany in Rhodes town,
from a humble origin, he Studied in Wittenberg university,
he was an orphan and was raised by kinsman, he mastered 
four branches of knowledge (theology, medicine, logic,
law)

**Q/ Discuss the view that Dr.Faustus represents the man who lived in the Renaissance**\?

Faustus sells his soul to the devil in order to get more
knowledge, he craved knowledge beyond the limits of 
humanity,this is the major theme of the Renaissance; 
that humans are the greatest thing in the universe
and they can achieve anything.

**Q/ Define the chorus and what does it say about the play in the opening speech**\?

The Chorus: Group of people that provides information and  
set the scene to the audience about the play, they are 
usually not part of the play.

In Dr.Faustus it mentions where he is from and what school
he went and his interest in black magic.

**Q/ Show how Faustus left all Branches of knowledge and decided to follow black magic**\?

In the first scene we see Faustus inside his private 
room discussing his mastery of all the branches of 
knowledge, First he begins with logic,he says that
The aim of logic is to be a good debater, thus it is useless.
Secondly he turns to medicine, 
he says that the aim of medicine is health,
and humans cannot live eternally or bring back dead people,
so he says goodbye to medicine too. Thirdly theology
In the Bible there is contradiction, because 
in one place it says that the reward of sin is death, 
and in another it says that everyone will sin, so Faustus 
abandon the Bible too. Fourthly law, he say it is useless as
well, and after that he chooses black magic.

**Q/ What do good and evil angels stands for**\?

They are abstract characters that represent the inner
conflict of Faustus, good angel tries to make him follow 
the path of god, bad angel tries to make him follow black 
magic.

**Q/ What was Mephistophilis first description of hell and give its dramatic value**\?

After Faustus asks Mephistophilis about hell,
Mephistophilis tells him about Lucifer, how he 
was a favorite angel to god once but because of his 
pride and insolence he was dismissed from heaven and 
had become eternally damned in hell with the fallen angels.

Mephistophilis says that being deprived of gods presence is
more tormenting than thousand hells.

### Q/ Comment on the following lines critically.

**Comment 1/ O, this cheers my soul!**\.

Faustus says this line to Valdes and Cornelius, after
they told him on what black magic can do, that he no longer
need to study anything else and enrich him 
with all branches of knowledge, this is a reference to the
Renaissance the age of the hunger for knowledge.

**Comment 2/ A sound magician is a demigod**\.

Faustus says this when he gets interested in black magic,
saying that a magician is like a god, who can do anything,
this was the turning point of Faustus from scholar 
to sorcerer.

**Comment 3/ O, by aspiring pride and insolence**\.

Mephistophilis says this line to Faustus about Lucifer,
how he was an angel once and was kicked from heaven because
he challenged God, his arrogance and insolence caused
him to be sent to hell.

**Comment 4/ This word "damnation" terrifies not him**\.

Faustus says this line to Mephistophilis after he abjure
god and the holy book, he tells Mephistophilis that he is not 
afraid to be damned (sent to hell) and willing to continue 
to sell his soul to Lucifer.

**Comment 5/ The reward of sin is death: that's hard**\.

Said by Faustus when he was discussing the uselessness of
all branches of knowledge and he arrives at theology.

Faustus reads the bible and finds a contradiction, in one
place it says the reward of sin is death, in another that
we all sin, Faustus wonders why god created us to go to 
hell,because of this he abandons theology.

**Comment 6/ The god thou serv'st is thine own apatite**\.

Faustus says this line after he hears a voice that tells 
him to abandon black magic and turn to god, Faustus says that
god doesn't love him, and that the god he serve is his own desires
and pleasures.


### Q/ Identify, comment and give the dramatic value of the following extract (quotation).

**Quote 1/ These metaphysics of magicians**\
**And necromantic books are heavenly;**\
**Lines, circles, scenes, letters, and characters;**\
**Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires**\.

These lines are said by Faustus after Faustus realizes 
that all branches of knowledge are useless, Faustus 
takes interest in necromantic books saying that 
those books are heavenly which is an irony because 
they are devilish.

**Quote 2/ O Faustus lay that damned book aside**\
**And Gaze not on it lest it tempt they soul**\
**and heap god's heavy wrath upon they head**\
**Read, read the scriptures: that is blasphemy**\.

These lines are said by Good Angel after Faustus 
interest in black magic,Good angel warn Faustus to leave 
necromantic books aside,because it corrupts the soul 
and that god will punish him for it, and read the holy 
books instead.

Good Angel is an abstract character that represent the good in Faustus

**Quote 3/ Go Forward Faustus, in that famous art**\
**Wherein all nature's treasure is contain'd:**\
**Be thou on earth as Jove is in the sky,**\
**Lord and commander of these elements**\.

These lines are said by Evil Angel after Faustus gets interested
in black magic, Evil Angel encourages Faustus to take black magic,
he seduced him with the great that comes from it,
telling him he will become like a god (like Jove, which is
a name for Roman god).

Evil Angel is an abstract character that represent the evil in Faustus.

**Quote 4/ I'll have them wall all Germany with brass,**\
**And make swift Rhine circle fair Wittenberg;**\
**I'll have them fill the public schools with silk,**\
**wherewith the students shall be bravely clad**\
**I'll levy soldiers with the coin they bring,**\
**And chase the Prince of Parma from our land,**\.

These lines are said by Faustus when he was waiting for Valdes and Cornelius,
Faustus is saying his 4 noble purposes when he gets his 
magic powers; First he will build a wall around Germany to protect it.
Second he will make the river *Rhine* circle around Wittenberg university.
Third he will make the students wear silk in public schools.
Fourth he will make a campaign of military to kick the Prince of Parma.

Though when Faustus got his power he pursued physical 
desires and trivial things.

**Quote 5/ Both law and physic are for petty wits;**\
**Divinity is basest of the three,**\
**unpleasant, harsh, contemptible, and vile:**\
**'Tis magic, magic that hath ravish'd me**\.

These lines are said by Faustus, when he was talking to Valdes and Cornelius,
Faustus says that both law and physics is useless, and that 
theology is even more useless, its magic that interest him and give him delight, 
the repetition of the word "magic" mark his definite decision to pursue necromancy.

**Quote 6/ I charge thee to return and change thy shape;**\
**Thou art too ugly to attend on me:**\
**Go and return an old Franciscan friar;**\
**That holy shape becomes a devil best**\.

These lines are said by Faustus, after Faustus preformed necromancy, 
Faustus tells these lines to Mephistophilis,
at his first appearance, he was too ugly so Faustus ordered
him to change his appearance and take the shape of a priest,
This is symbolic to the fact that some clergymen (priests)
are hypocrites (pretending goodness while they are evil inside).

**Quote 7/ That was the cause but yet per accidents:**\
**For, when we hear one rack the name of God,**\
**Abjure the Scriptures and his Saviour Christ,**\
**We fly, in hope to get his glorious soul;**\
**Nor will we come, unless he use such means**\.

These lines are said by Mephistophilis, after Faustus asked if he was the
one who conjured him, Mephistophilis answers that when devils hear someone
curse the name of god and abjure him, they fly to him
happily to get his "glorious soul", an irony because 
the person soul will be damned.

**Quote 8/ Of wealth !**\
**Why, the signiory of Emden shall be mine.**\
**When Mephistophilis shall stand by me**\
**What God can hurt thee, Faustus? Thou art safe.**\
**Cast no more doubts--come, Mephistophilis**\.

These lines are said by Faustus, after Faustus had an inner 
conflict to leave black magic, Faustus is convinced by 
Evil Angel to stay in necromancy, leaving his spirit and turning to his 
physical desires, wanting to rule over Emden city, and having Mephistophilis 
in his side he is safe from any god's harm.

**Quote 9/ Then, Faustus stab thine arm courageously**\
**And bind thy soul, that at some certain day**\
**Great Lucifer may claim it as his own**\
**And then be thou as great as Lucifer**\.

These lines are said by Mephistophilis, after Faustus agrees to give 
his soul to Lucifer, Mephistophilis tells Faustus that in order to gain Lucifer's
powers he has to give his soul to Lucifer, and sign a contract  using his blood
that he will get from stabbing his arm.

**Quote 10/ But what is this inscription on mine arm?**\
**Homo, fuge:whither should i fly?**\
**If unto God, he'll throw me down to hell.**\
**My senses are deceiv'd, here's nothing writ:-**\
**I see it plain; here in this place is writ,**\
**Homo, fuge: yet shall not Faustus fly.**\

These lines are said by Faustus,after Faustus blood congeals 
and Mephistophilis helps him clear it, Faustus sees an inscription on 
his arm that says "Home,fuge" which means "flee", at first he thinks that his eyes
are deceiving him, but then he looks again and sees the inscription clearly,
he acknowledges that if he tries to flee to God, God will throw him in hell, so he ignore this
and continue to sign the contract with his blood.
