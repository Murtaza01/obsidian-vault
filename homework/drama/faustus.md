O Faustus lay that damned book aside
And Gaze not on it lest it tempt they soul
and heap god's heavy wrath upon they head
Read, read the scriptures: that is blasphemy
-
Said by: **Good Angel**
**Scene 1**

After Faustus decided to take black magic, good angel
come to him and tells him to leave this book of
magic aside, because it corrupts the soul and that god
will punish him for it, and read the wholly books instead.

Good Angel is an abstract character that represent the good in Faustus

Go Forward Faustus, in that famous art
Wherein all nature's treasure is contain'd:
Be thou on earth as Jove is in the sky,
Lord and commander of these elements.
-
Said by: **Evil Angel**
**Scene 1**

Evil Angel encourages Faustus to take black magic,
he seduced him with the great that comes from it,
telling him he will become like a god (like Jove, which is
a name for Roman god).

Evil Angel is an abstract character that represent the evil in Faustus

Q/ What do good and evil angels stands for?

They are abstract characters that represent the inner
conflict of Faustus, good angel tries to make him follow 
the path of god, bad angel tries to make him follow black 
magic.

These metaphysics of magicians
And necromantic books are heavenly;
Lines, circles, scenes, letters, and characters;
Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires.
-
Said by: Faustus.
**Scene 1**
When he was in his study.

After Faustus realize that all branches of knowledge 
are useless and that it is hard to follow the doctrine of 
god, he then turns to black magic, saying that those
books are heavenly (as irony because they are devilish).

I'll have them wall all Germany with brass,
And make swift Rhine circle fair Wittenberg;
I'll have them fill the public schools with silk,
wherewith the students shall be bravely clad
I'll levy soldiers with the coin they bring,
And chase the Prince of Parma from our land,
-
Said by: Faustus
**Scene 1**
When he was waiting for Valdes and Cornelius.

Faustus is saying his 4 noble purposes when he gets his 
magic powers which are:

- Build a wall around Germany to protect it.
- Make the river *Rhine* circle around Wittenberg university.
- Enrich public schools with resources. 
- Make a campaign of military to kick the Prince of Parma.

Though when Faustus got his power he pursued physical 
desires and trivial things.

Both law and physic are for petty wits;
Divinity is basest of the three,
unpleasant, harsh, contemptible, and vile:
'Tis magic, magic that hath ravish'd [^1] me.
-

Said By: Faustus.
Scene 1
when he was talking to Valdes and Cornelius.

Faustus says that both law and physics are useless, and that 
divinity are even more inferior of the three, its magic that 
interest him and give him delight.

The repetition of the word "**magic**" mark his definite decision to pursue
necromancy (black magic).

[^1]:  Fill someone with intense delight.

I charge thee to return and change thy shape;
Thou art too ugly to attend on me:
Go and return an old Franciscan friar;
That holy shape becomes a devil best.
-

Said by: Faustus.
Scene 3
after Faustus preformed necromancy.

Faustus tells these lines to Mephistophilis (the devil),
at his first appearance, he was too ugly so Faustus ordered
him to change his appearance and take the shape of a **priest**.

This is symbolic to the fact that some clergymen (priests)
are hypocrites (pretending goodness while they are evil inside).
