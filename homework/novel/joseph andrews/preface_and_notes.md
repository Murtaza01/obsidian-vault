A vain man exaggerate his virtues, it is excessive pride in one ability,
Henry thinks the vain man is better than the hypocrite, because at least
the vain man has some virtues but not to the degree he claim

opposite virtues, in Henry view, he is the worst of the two kinds, because
what is more ridicules than someone who is the reverse of what he claims to be.
