is monstrous and unnatural, and the delight comes from the
surprising absurdity. While the comic derived from nature. 

Henry uses burlesque in his diction[^2] only.

it allow for freedom in its creation, and thus it is similar to burlesque.

are exaggerated in order to create a comic effect

# Affectation[^4]

Henry thinks that the only source of ridicules is affectation,
which he attributes to two main causes: **vanity** and **hypocrisy**

### Vanity

A vain man exaggerate his virtues, it is excessive pride in one ability,
Henry thinks the vain man is better than the hypocrite, because at least
the vain man has some virtues but not to the degree he claim

### Hypocrisy

A hypocrite is a person that conceal his vices under an appearance of their
opposite virtues, in Henry view, he is the worst of the two kinds, because
what is more ridicules than someone who is the reverse of what he claims to be?
