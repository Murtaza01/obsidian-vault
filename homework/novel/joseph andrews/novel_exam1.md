# Summary 

Joseph Andrews was Written By Henry Feilding 1742, it was an 
imitation of Don Quixote by Cervantes and a critique to his 
contemporaries works: Pamela by Samuel Richardson and Colley Cibber 
autobiography.

The work was a new species of writing, so he needed a manual for the English reader,
he defined his work as (comic epic poem in prose).

He called it epic poem because his work was extended and 
comprehensive and include a verity of character,epics always 
had god-like characters and they were written in verse,
Instead his work was about ordinary people and was written in prose.

Because its comedy, the work deals with the ridiculous, Henry sees affectation
the source of the true ridiculous, and affectation has two main sources:hypocrisy and
vanity.

The novel is about Joseph (Joey) a young boy who came from low-birth and
unknown parents and family tree, this challenges the reader expectation because
all epics had family trees with kings and warriors.
