\head{Historical Background of the Seventeen Century}

\subhead{King x Parliament}

Both \textit{James I} and his son \textit{Charles I} thought that kings ruled 
by \underLine{Divine Right}. They abused the power of ruling, made illegal taxes
on working people. They were in constant disputes with the Parliament and tried 
many times to rule without them which lead to the civil war.

\subhead{Civil War (1642-1649)}

The civil war happened between \textit{Charles I} and his supporters 
(\underLine{the Royalist}) against the Parliament and their supporters which were
merchants and tradesmen, they were of the common people and were called (\underLine{the Roundheads}). 
With the help of Scotland the Parliament defeated the king and executed him on 1649.

\subhead{The Puritans}

In the seventeen century there were two major religious groups: the
\textit{Puritans} who were very strict and thought that all entertainment is
distasteful to God. And the \textit{Catholics} who wanted the Pope in Rome to 
be the head of the church.\medbreak

In (1649-1660) \underLine{Oliver Cromwell} who was a Puritan ruled England. He closed the 
theaters and other entertainments because he thought they were distraction
from the Bible. In the Restoration period people started to be more vulgar and 
indulgent as a reaction to the Puritans strict rules.

\head{School of Ben Jonson}

The school of Ben or the \textit{Tribe of Ben} were group of poets who imitated
Ben Jonson style. They were Royalist and were called \underLine{Cavalier Poets} because they
supported king \textit{Charles I} against the Parliament. This group included: 
\underLine{Thomas Carew}, \underLine{Richard Lovelace}, 
\underLine{John Suckling}, \underLine{Robert Herrick}. \hl{Ben and his followers often wrote 
carpe diem poems}.\medbreak

and the need to live in the moment.

\subhead{Ben Jonson}

Playwright, critic and poet. Was part of the Royalist who supported 
king Charles I. He lived in the city, 
so most of \underLine{his work were about 
the city side} (urban side). He was influenced by classical 
literature (Greek and Roman) and imitated their style. He used
\textbf{classicism}\footnote{the following of Greek and Roman style and 
principles in literature.} 
in his form. \underLine{\textbf{John Donne} was his rival-artist}, his 
form was complex, scientific and included metaphysical elements unlike
Ben's form which was simple and plain.

Kindles in clothes a wantonness;\\
A lawn about the shoulders thrown\\
Into a fine distraction;\\
An erring lace, which here and there\\
Enthrals the crimson stomacher;\\
A cuff neglectful, and thereby\\
Ribands to flow confusedly;\\
A winning wave, (deserving note),\\
In the tempestuous petticoat;\\
A careless shoe-string, in whose tie\\
I see a wild civility:\\
Do more bewitch me, than when art\\
Is too precise in every part.
