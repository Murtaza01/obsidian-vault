## What is our Life By Walter Ralegh

that happens between scenes, god is the wise and fair spectator (audience),
the grave is the curtains when the play is done.

## The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd By Walter Ralegh

In this poem Walter replies to Marlowe's poem The 
Passionate Shepherd to his love, he gives a realistic
view of the country side, saying that when the night comes
the cold and the cares comes with it, the birds hide,
the gown, shoes, cap, and the bed of roses will all be broken and forgotten.

the country side, speaking through a nymph,
replying to each description of Marlow's poem,
in the couplet the Nymph conclude that if youth and happiness 
is eternal then *maybe* she might love him.
