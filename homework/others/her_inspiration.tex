\section*{\centering Her Inspiration}\vspace{1cm}

How heavy talking to her feels\\
as if my heart is on fire. \\
her beauty makes the strongest men tears,\\
and the thought of her never tire.\bigbreak

Like a child just born into the world,\\
so do I, desire to discover her.\\
I don't think i can ever be bored \\
until I know everything about her;\\
her mind, humor, fears and sadness,\\
but to be this close, is just madness.\bigbreak

How do I feed her heed,\\
but not lose myself?\\
How do I satisfy her need, \\
but not hurt myself?\\
Sometimes fears comes to my mind:\\
'She doesn't care, doesn't feel' or worse:\\
'There is a lucky one' and i go blind\\
to my purpose and my desired course.\bigbreak

I refuse to make her care for me\\
for this feels like begging for her love\\
nothing can ever compel me\\
not society nor mind, can change how i move.\\
Wasting to know this beautiful soul\\
just because I'm afraid of pain.\\
No, I'm not such a coward fool\\
as I accept the long trip of the train.\\
All I want is to know and be kind to her \\
for I feel myself  when I'm around her.
