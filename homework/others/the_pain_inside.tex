\section*{\centering The Pain Inside}\vspace{1cm}

I wish I could be close to you,\\
to feel you, and think of you, \\
but I do not even want to talk to you\\ 
because then I would know \\
that I'm not good for you.\\
To be close to you is heaven,\\
but for me that is forbidden.\bigbreak

I always have to face the competition,\\
but how is it fair? When i have no ammunition.\\
Some days I feel that i have the sword,\\
but all I have is a pen, and my own road.\\
A road that is destined for darkness,\\
but at least I have a rested conscious.\bigbreak

I wish I know what I lack\\
so I could work on it \\
and be on the track,\\
but the pain always attacks.\\
Sometimes I wish i could cry \\
but for some reason, my eyes are dry\\
maybe you could teach me how to try.\bigbreak

In a perfect world, you would guide me,\\
to your arms, so you can hide me,\\
to let out all the pains inside me.\\
In a perfect... There is no perfect world!\\
Only for a while, then I turn to scold\\
myself, for ever indulging in this world.
