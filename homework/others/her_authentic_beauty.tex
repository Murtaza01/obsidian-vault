\section*{\centering Her Authentic Beauty}\vspace{1cm}

You walk in vain, but I swear,\\
I will never see such beauty again;\\
Like a pearl hidden in the sea,\\
no one but the fortune can see.\\
Your desires, feelings and needs,\\
touch the very soul of the person you meet;\\
The depth of them and the fluency of your words,\\
inspires the most profound tenderness and warmth.\\
In exchange for words\\
you get the fain\\
you get the rain\\
I get the mud.\bigbreak

The presence will go and you might feel blue\\
but your feelings are nothing but true.\\
Your beauty pierce one's armor, \\
and makes his coldest days warmer;\\
He will feel grateful for ever knowing you\\
and lucky, because he is near you.\\ 
When you snap your fingers, just remember;\\
that your beauty is just like the thunder.\\
Her beauty inspires awe and commentary,\\
your beauty inspires intellect and poetry.\\
She walks in superfluous beauty\\
you walk in authentic reality.
