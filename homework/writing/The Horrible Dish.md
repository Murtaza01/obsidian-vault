My mother always makes the best food, i love my mother's cooking, sometimes though i ended up lying to her to not hurt her feelings.

%% She takes our judgement about her food very personally, so whenever we say that we do not like her food, she gets upset and feels as if she is not a good mother. %%

One day she made a new dish, she was excited to hear our opinion, and when i tasted it, it was horrible, i smiled and said it was great, she told me "well than i will let you finish the whole dish!", so i forced myself to eat it, i still feel the horrible taste in my mouth

i think we should tell the truth at such times, and try to be as polite as possible.
