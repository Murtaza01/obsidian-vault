Social media is one of the most used things in the world, it gives a simple premise; a way to connect with other people around the world.

Yet i do not know anyone who uses them in that way, in fact it is mostly has the opposite effect, it makes people feel unconnected and lonely.

One of the worst effect social media has on people is discontent, it makes them constantly comparing themselves to the more fortunate people, to the people that already there to show their skills.

This causes us, sometimes not even consciously, to blame ourselves, to feel discontent with our own progress in life, constantly wanting more, as being content now is a sort of defeat.

Its more worse when people have the wrong idea about what contentment is, it is not siting still and not wanting to do anything, it is not the opposite of motivation.

It is simply a big part of being happy, it means we are satisfied with our current progress, we are satisfied with who we are and what we do, it comes from a place of knowledge about ones life, humility and acceptance.

Something which is not so easy and rare these days, i do not know what makes other people happy, but i do know that in order to be happy you have to be content in some sort.
