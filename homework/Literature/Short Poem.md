Poetry can be, anything i want
its just some words, composed with notes

its not as good as people may think
that's why its reputation must shrink

words can be whatever you may
good,bad, even and grey

this is not mockery or joke
its just a way to prove a point

because action speaks louder than words
and that's a matter of facts that's known
