# Phonology

Is the study of the function of sounds and their relationship
between each other, in other words it is the study of the abstract
side of the sounds of language. 

## BBC Pronunciation or RP

RP is misleading and outdated, the use of the word `received` to mean
accepted or approved implies that it is the accent approved in British,
and other accents are not approved.

So it is better to use the term BBC (British Broadcasting Channel) since the accent is mostly used in
announcers and news reads of the BBC channel.
