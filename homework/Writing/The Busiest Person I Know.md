My mother is a very busy person, she works two jobs, one in the morning in an office where she manage bank accounts, the second is as a gardener after she finishes from her office.

Still even though she works two jobs, she still have time for me and my sister, she provide for us because my father left when i was young, and all the responsibility lies on her.

She is very hard worker and all what she do, she do it for us, to help us go through good college and have a good life, i am very grateful that she is my mother.

She works hard at her job, but she always has time for me
