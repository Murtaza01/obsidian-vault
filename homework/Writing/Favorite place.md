one of my favorite places is in my college garden, i sit on a bench next to fountain the garden is often quite and does not have many people, i always go there to read a book, i especially like it when its a sunny day, and there is not a lot of noise

it makes me feel calm and remind me how peaceful life can be, although sometimes i do feel lonely, especially when i see people walk by with their friends, but the sensation (of being lonely) although painful, but it does not last for long

i try to sit there as much as possible because it makes me feel alive at times
