when i was in high school, i had a teacher named Waffa, she was really unforgettable person, i still remember everything about her, every student disliked her because she was strict and tough on us, she would give a lot of homework and sometimes get upset if we do not do it.

I understood her, i liked her even, because of her care and devotion, not only to us, but as a teacher, she carried her duty and did the right thing, i understood why she would get upset, because she carried whether we study and get good grades or not.

After class, she was kind and caring, she never turn down anyone need of help, and always cares for us.

She was strict but fair, i learned much from her and would never forgot the impact she had on me.
